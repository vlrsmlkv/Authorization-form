# Authorization form :lock:
This is a simple authorization form I've made because I really wanted to create something on my own.

Good news is it's not that shitty as I thought it would be :sweat_smile:

## About :memo:
The authorization form has 2 awesome unput fields with cool animation! One is for login, another - for password (impressive, isn't it?). Moreover, you can click on "Submit" button and see values from input fields displayed on the web console.

My next step is to get understanding of REST API. 

## Stack :woman_technologist:
- JavaScript 
- HTML
- CSS

## What I really like :sparkles:
- beautiful colorful gradient background and button...
I hope you like it as much as I do! Otherwise I'm not sure we can be friends...

Special thanks go to my mentor and best friend [Mishanya](https://github.com/OUghTMS/). All of that wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for him.
