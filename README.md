# Authorization form :lock:
This is a simple authorization form I've made because I've been told to.

Good news is it's not that shitty as I thought it would be :sweat_smile:

## How to use 
Just download all of my 3 awesome files (including one ugly css file). Then click on form.html file. Enjoy cool animation in input fields!
I hope you like it (but i doubt it)!

## By the way
It looks ugly everywhere except of desktop version (but I'm not sure about that either).

Special thanks go to my mentor and best friend [Mishanya](https://github.com/OUghTMS/). All of that wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for him.
